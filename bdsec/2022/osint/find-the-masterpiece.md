# Find the Masterpiece 
### 50 Points

## Information

    My friend gave me the following stream of numbers and told me to figure out something of it. He gave me a hint that, the thing hidden behind the numbers is very known to me and piano keys might help me to solve the challenge. He also claimed that it is a master piece. So, he also asked for the creation date of that master piece. Please help me to solve that mistery!

    Flag Format: BDSEC{name_of_the_master_piece,year}

    Special note: All the letter of the flag are lower case and there will be a special character in the flag unlike the other challenge flags.


## Steps done

1. We opened a virtual Piano like https://virtualpiano.net/ 
2. We assumed that the numbers are the piano keys numbers
3. We played the song and we recognized the melody of the movie "Pirates of the Caribbean"
4. The song name is "He's a pirate" and the release date is 2003
5. We entered the flag in the specified format `BDSEC{heâ€™s_a_pirate,2003}`
